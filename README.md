# Step-wise Averaging version of Ring All Reduce Algorithms in Distributed Deep Learning

Attached are the results and my final report [here](final_report.pdf).

The below image captures the jist of my idea. This way we could reduce the network activity for faster distributed training across geographically far-away HPC/AI systems.
